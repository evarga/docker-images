Docker Images Project
=====================

Contains various [Docker][1] build files for creating Docker images (base images, intermediate images, etc.). Each folder is designated to one particular image, and has a Dockerfile (besides other build related stuff). Every Dockerfile is well commented and should be consulted for more information what it represents.
